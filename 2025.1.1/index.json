The interface's media specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and format of the value contained by this object. For interfaces that do not have such an address (for example, a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length. everyone AdminStatus System.String The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up (1) or testing (3) states (or remains in the down (2) state). everyone OperStatus System.String The current operational state of the interface. The testing (3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down (2) then ifOperStatus should be down (2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up (1) then ifOperStatus should change to up (1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down (2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up (1) state. everyone InterfaceMTU System.Int32 The size of the largest packet that can be sent or received on the interface, specified in octets.

This object should contain a string that identifies the manufacturer's name for the physical entity, and should be set to a distinct value for each version or model of the physical entity. everyone EntityType System.String An indication of the vendor-specific hardware type of the physical entity. Note that this is different from the definition of MIB-II's sysObjectID. An agent should set this object to a enterprise-specific registration identifier value indicating the specific equipment type in detail. The associated instance of entPhysicalClass is used to indicate the general type of hardware device.

A value of zero indicates this physical entity is not contained in any other physical entity. Note that the set of 'containment' relationships define a strict hierarchy; that is, recursion is not allowed. In the event a physical entity is contained by more than one physical entity (for example, double-wide modules) , this object should identify the containing entity with the lowest value of entPhysicalIndex. everyone EntityClass System.String An indication of the general hardware type of the physical entity. An agent should set this object to the standard enumeration value that most accurately indicates the general class of the physical entity or the primary class if there is more than one. If no appropriate standard registration identifier exists for this physical entity, then the value 'other(1)' is returned. If the value is unknown by this agent, then the value 'unknown(2)' is returned. everyone Position System.Int32 An indication of the relative position of this 'child' component among all its 'sibling' components. Sibling components are defined as entPhysicalEntries that share the same instance values of each of the entPhysicalContainedIn and entPhysicalClass objects. everyone HardwareRevision System.String The vendor-specific hardware revision string for the physical entity. The preferred value is the hardware revision identifier actually printed on the component itself (if present). Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (for example, binary) format, then the agent must convert such information to a printable format, in an implementation-specific manner.

Note that if revision information is stored internally in a non-printable (for example, binary) format , then the agent must convert such information to a printable format , in an implementation-specific manner. If no specific firmware programs are associated with the physical component, or this information is unknown to the agent, then this object contains a zero-length string. everyone SoftwareRevision System.String The vendor-specific software revision string for the physical entity.

The preferred value is the manufacturer name string actually printed on the component itself (if present). everyone Model System.String The vendor-specific model name identifier string associated with this physical component. The preferred value is the customer-visible part number, which may be printed on the component itself. If the model name string associated with the physical component is unknown to the agent, then this object contains a zero-length string. everyone Alias System.String This object is an 'alias' name for the physical entity as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the physical entity. everyone AssetID System.String This object is a user-assigned asset tracking identifier for the physical entity as specified by a network manager, and provides non-volatile storage of this information. everyone FieldReplaceable System.String This object indicates whether or not this physical entity is considered a 'field replaceable unit' by the vendor. If this object contains the value 'true(1)' then this entPhysicalEntry identifies a field replaceable unit. For all entPhysicalEntries that represent components that are permanently contained within a field replaceable unit, the value 'false(2)' should be returned for this object. everyone NodeID System.Guid A SWIS-generated unique identifier of a network node in the current inventory.

Inheritance ↳ System.Entity Access control everyone Properties Name Type Summary Access Control InterfaceIndex System.Int32 A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface. SolarWinds recommends assigning values contiguously starting from 1. The value for each interface sub-layer must remain constant at least from one reinitialization of the entity's network management system to the next reinitialization. everyone InterfaceDescription System.String A textual string containing information about the interface. This string should include the name of the manufacturer, the product name, and the version of the interface hardware or software. everyone InterfaceName System.String The textual name of the interface. The value of this object should be the name of the interface as assigned by the local device and should be suitable for use in commands entered at the device's 'console'. This might be a text name, such as 'le0' or a simple port number, such as '1' , depending on the interface naming syntax of the device. If several entries in the ifTable together represent a single interface as named by the device, then each entry has the same value of ifName. If there is no local name, or this object is otherwise not applicable, then this object contains a 0-length string. everyone InterfaceAlias System.String This object is an 'alias' name for the interface as specified by a network manager, and provides a non-volatile 'handle' for the interface. everyone InterfaceType System.Int32 The type of interface. Additional values for ifType are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax of the IANAifType textual convention. everyone InterfaceTypeName System.String The type of interface. Additional values for ifType are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax of the IANAifType textual convention. everyone InterfaceTypeDescription System.String The type of interface. Additional values for ifType are assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), through updating the syntax of the IANAifType textual convention. everyone InterfaceSpeed System.Double An estimate of the interface's current bandwidth in bits per second. For interfaces that do not vary in bandwidth or for those where no accurate estimation can be made, this object should contain the nominal bandwidth. If the bandwidth of the interface is greater than the maximum value reportable by this object then this object should report its maximum value (4, 294, 967, 295) and ifHighSpeed must be used to report the interface’s speed. For a sub-layer that has no concept of bandwidth, this object should be zero. everyone MACAddress System.String The interface's address at its protocol sublayer. The interface's media specific MIB must define the bit and byte ordering and format of the value contained by this object. For interfaces that do not have such an address (for example, a serial line), this object should contain an octet string of zero length. everyone AdminStatus System.String The desired state of the interface. The testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. When a managed system initializes, all interfaces start with ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state. As a result of either explicit management action or per configuration information retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then changed to either the up (1) or testing (3) states (or remains in the down (2) state). everyone OperStatus System.String The current operational state of the interface. The testing (3) state indicates that no operational packets can be passed. If ifAdminStatus is down (2) then ifOperStatus should be down (2). If ifAdminStatus is changed to up (1) then ifOperStatus should change to up (1) if the interface is ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an incoming connection); it should remain in the down (2) state if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going to the up (1) state. everyone InterfaceMTU System.Int32 The size of the largest packet that can be sent or received on the interface, specified in octets. For interfaces that are used for transmitting network datagrams, this is the size of the largest network datagram that can be sent on the interface. everyone LastChange System.DateTime The value of sysUpTime at the time the interface entered its current operational state. If the current state was entered prior to the last re-initialization of the local network management subsystem, then this object contains a zero value. everyone PhysicalInterface System.Char This object has the value 'true(1)' if the interface sublayer has a physical connector and the value 'false(2)' otherwise. everyone Promiscuous System.Char This object has a value of false(2) if this interface only accepts packets/frames that are addressed to this station. This object has a value of true(1) when the station accepts all packets/frames transmitted on the media. The value true(1) is only legal on certain types of media. If legal, setting this object to a value of true(1) may require the interface to be reset before becoming effective. The value of ifPromiscuousMode does not affect the reception of broadcast and multicast packets/frames by the interface. everyone InterfaceID System.Guid Interface ID. Primary key. everyone NodeID System.Guid A SWIS-generated unique identifier of a network node in the current inventory. (Instances of this property recur in this table according to the number of Cisco devices for which data is reported.) everyone LastDiscovery System.DateTime A SWIS-generated date and time marker for when NCM last discovered the device during inventory. everyone FirstDiscovery System.DateTime A SWIS-generated date and time marker for when NCM first discovered the device during inventory. everyone Missing System.Boolean Not used. everyone VLANID System.Int32 The set of the device's member ports that belong to the VLAN. Each octet within the value of this object specifies a set of eight ports, with the first octet specifying ports 1 through 8, the second octet specifying ports 9 through 16, etc. Within each octet, the most significant bit represents the lowest numbered port, and the least significant bit represents the highest numbered port. Thus, each port of the VLAN is represented by a single bit within the value of this object. If that bit has a value of '1' then that port is included in the set of ports. The port is not included if its bit has a value of '0'. A port number is the value of dot1dBasePort for the port in the BRIDGE-MIB (RFC 1493). everyone PortStatus System.String An indication of the current VLAN status of the port. A status of inactive(1) indicates that a dynamic port does not yet have a VLAN assigned, or a port is assigned to a VLAN that is currently not active. A status of active(2) indicates that the currently assigned VLAN is active. A status of shutdown(3) indicates that the port has been disabled as a result of VQP shutdown response.
